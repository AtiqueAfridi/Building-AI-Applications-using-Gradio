This project was intended to design a text summarization app using Python libraries and Gradio.
It requires the use of the Hugging Face API key and the Inference Endpoints for the shleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6, a 306M parameter distilled model from facebook/bart-large-cnn.
You can make live demo shareable links that work for 72 hours and is live on the server of Hugging Face .
This can also be deployed to Spaces on Hugging Face
